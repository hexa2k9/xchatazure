XChat Azure is a fork from X-Chat Aqua, the MacOSX native XChat front-end.

Why renamed?
====
Mac appstore is very useful place to distribute appliactions for non-geek users. Most of Debian/Utuntu users do not want to search applications on broad Internet world, if you can access alternative application on Aptitude. Also mac users do.

But I should keep Apple Appstore guideline to submit X-Chat Aqua. There was some issues.

*Main Reason: Any appliaciton on Appstore should not use the name includes 'Mac', 'OSX', 'Aqua' or any Apple's tarde marks.

There was no way. I dropped the name.
Also, where was several other issues because i didn't want to change X-Chat Aqua developement policy.

#We should remove whole ppc/ppc64 support
#We should remove update module (Sparkle, in this case)
#We should not work on ~/.xchat2 the traditional configutaion directory.

It should be annoying job to keep these on X-Chat Aqua.


Move Aqua to Azure
====
If you are now using XChat GTK or X-Chat Aqua, and now you want to move to XChat Azure, you should do some work.

Unlike XChat GTK and X-Chat Aqua, XChat Azure do not share the traditional configuration direcotry ~/.xchat2 because of Appstore guideline.

So if you want to keep your configuration, you should move it, copy it, or make hard link.

#Ready: Open Terminal.app to do this job. You can find it on Spotlight
#Ready2: Did you run XChat Azure already? Remove its configuration to do other job.
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/XChat\ Azure
#Move, if you will not user XChat GTK or X-Chat Aqua.
mv ~/.xchat2 ~/Library/Application\ Support/XChat\ Azure
#Copy, if you will use different configuration on Aqua and Azure, or you want to test Azure and back to original X-Chat Aqua.
cp -R ~/.xchat2 ~/Library/Application\ Support/XChat\ Azure
#Make hard link, if you want to share configurations.
OMG.. I don't know how to do. Do it yourself.
